My name is Michael West. I've been doing software engineering professionally for 5 years. 
I'm constantly looking for a new language, new project to start.
I believe that creativity reaches its peak by engaging in diverse realms of thought. Creativity is diversity of thought.

I'm a self-proclaimed geography nerd. Before I started down my path as a software engineer I dreamed of being a geographer/cartographer. I used to study maps for hours on end. Those days are over but I still retain my passion for making and reading maps. I'd love to combine my two passions through [Geoinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoinformatics).
